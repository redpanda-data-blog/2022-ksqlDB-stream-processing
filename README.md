# How to use ksqlDB and Redpanda to build a materialized cache

Learn how to use ksqlDB with Redpanda to create a real-time materialized cache.

Follow along with [this tutorial on the Redpanda blog](https://redpanda.com/blog/ksqldb-materialized-cache) to put this demo into action. 

-------------------------------------

## Setting up  
You'll need to have docker and docker-compose installed before getting started.
1. Clone this repo and navigate to the directory as shown below:

```
git clone https://github.com/redpanda-data-blog/2022-ksqlDB-stream-processing.git

cd 2022-ksqlDB-stream-processing
```


2. Start the stack
```
docker-compose up -d
```
3. Start ksqlDB's interactive CLI

```
docker exec -it ksqldb-cli ksql http://ksqldb-server:8088
```

4. Run initial script
```
RUN SCRIPT '/etc/sql/init.sql';
```

The script does the following:
- Creates a stream
- Creates materialized views

6. Populates stream with events

In the interactive CLI, copy and paste the content of `file/sql/data.sql` to populate stream with data. 

Example;

```sql
-- in ksqldb
INSERT INTO emergencies (name, reason, area) VALUES ('Liam', 'allergy', 'Florida'); 
or 
-- in redpanda
{"name":"Beckham", "reason": "allergy", "area": "New York"}
```

7. Configure ksqlDB to read from start of stream
```
SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';
```

7. Make Queries

Start another ksqlDB's interactive CLI and run the query in `files/sql/query-example.sql`. 

Example;

```
SELECT * FROM location_of_interest
WHERE reason = 'allergy' EMIT CHANGES;
```

8. Add more data to the stream (first CLI instance) and observe the changes in the query (second CLI instance).
